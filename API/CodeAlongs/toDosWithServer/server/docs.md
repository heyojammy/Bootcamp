Consuming an API

Third party tells us what endpoints/routes
What type of response - json or xml or something else 3) Do we need authentication or authorization
How much data - everything or or specifics 5) How many requests can I make????
What data we can actually get - name, birthday, or everything!!!
Building an API

We get to decide what the endpoints/routes are and methods
We decide on what type of data - json or xml or primitives
We decide how much data the client gets back
We decide what data is actually returned - we are going to send SS#!!!!?
We decide the status code to send
CRUD - what is it? Create - adding a todo to our list - POST method Read - get todos and display it - GET method Update - have we completed the todo - mark it with a line - PUT method Delete - remove the todo from our list - DELETE method
