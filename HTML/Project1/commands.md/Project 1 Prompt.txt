The goal of this project is to get you familiar with how to use the CLI.

Create a file called commands.md

You can paste your queries into the file and submit to Github. You will not be submittiing anything else.

Perform the following using your CLI - NO GUI!!:

On your desktop, create a folder named “soups”.

Go inside of your soups folder. Create a file called “ChickenNoodle.html” and “BakedPotato.css”

While you are inside of the soups folder, create another folder called “js”.

Go inside of the js folder.

Where are we? Display the current path that we are on.

Now go back 'up' to the soups folder.

Create a file called “CreamyTomato.js” and put it in the js folder while still in the soups folder.

Create a file called “readme.txt.” in the soups folder.

On second thought, maybe we do not need a readme file right. Delete “readme.txt”.

Go into the js folder.

You decide you are not in the mood for creamy tomato. Rename “CreamyTomato.js” to “BroccoliCheddar.js”.

You’re done!
