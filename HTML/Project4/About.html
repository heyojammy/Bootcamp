<h1>About Jaimmika</h1>

<p id ="p1">Hey there! My name is Jaimmika <em>(jay-mih-kuh)</em>. I am 30 years old and am from the land up yonder. I was born in a tiny
    town called Bad Axe in the great Mitten State, Michigan. My hometown has a grand total of <strong>3,000 people</strong>, and 
    my graduating class in high school was a whopping 100 students. <strong>Wowowowow</strong>. 
<br>
<br>
    As a youg, angsty teen, I got into a group of friends comprised of misfits - the emos, the goths, the weebs. Beautiful alt people. 
    I got into anime and was pretty much a big ol' nerd and developed big dreams of going to Japan. 
<br>
<br>
    So I went to college and...well...went to Japan! Loved it so much I decided I would go back. So I did that too. I taught English for 
    two years over there, and then came back to America (still wondering why I did that lol). 
<br>
<br>
    And now I'm here, in big ol' Texas. I've learned how to say "y'all" and super love TacoDeli's breakfast tacos. I somewhat know what migas is.
