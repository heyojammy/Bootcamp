Use a bash command to create a file named YourName.txt with no content in it. 
    touch YourName.txt
 
        Look at the permissions.
            ls -l YourName.txt

        Now change the permissions so everyone can read it and execute it.
            chmod u=rx,g=rx,o=rx YourName.txt

        Now change the permissions so only you can read it.
            chmod u=r YourName.txt
