            <img className="selfie" src="Assets/jaimmika2.jpg"></img>

            <p>Hey there! My name is Jaimmika <em>(jay-mih-kuh)</em>. I am 30 years old and am from the land up yonder. I was born in a tiny
            town called Bad Axe in the great Mitten State, Michigan. My hometown has a grand total of <strong>3,000 people</strong>, and 
            my graduating class in high school was a whopping 100 students. <strong>Wowowowow</strong>.</p>

            <p>As a youg, angsty teen, I got into a group of friends comprised of misfits - the emos, the goths, the weebs. Beautiful alt people. 
            I got into anime and was pretty much a big ol' nerd and developed big dreams of going to Japan. </p>

            <p>So I went to college and...well...went to Japan! Loved it so much I decided I would go back. So I did that too. I taught English for 
            two years over there, and then came back to America (still wondering why I did that lol).</p>

            <p>And now I'm here, in big ol' Texas. I've learned how to say "y'all" and super love TacoDeli's breakfast tacos. I somewhat know what migas is.</p>
